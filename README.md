# ISOI_Grid
Iterative Successive Orthogonal Image code for rotational "grids" in SO(3). 
These codes can be used to generate uniform samples of spheres, ellipsoids and rotation groups. They are distributed as-is with no intended warranty or guarantee of suitability for any purpose.

HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN:

Go into the source directory,and type make.

SO3_Grid [type] [level]: Use a standard or layered grid type and a level>1 to determine how finely sampled the output will be.
